## Script Management & Analytics

Bordful uses Next.js's built-in Script component for optimal script loading and performance. Scripts can be configured in `config/config.ts`:

```typescript
scripts: {
  head: [
    // Scripts to load in the <head> section
    {
      src: "your-script-url",
      strategy: "afterInteractive", // or "beforeInteractive", "lazyOnload"
      attributes: {
        // Additional script attributes
        "data-custom": "value",
        defer: "", // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      },
    },
  ],
  body: [
    // Scripts to load at the end of <body>
  ],
}
```

### Script Loading Strategies

- **beforeInteractive**: Use for critical scripts that must load before page becomes interactive
- **afterInteractive**: Best for analytics and non-critical tracking (default)
- **lazyOnload**: For low-priority scripts that can load last

### Analytics Integration

The starter comes pre-configured for Umami Analytics:
1. Scripts are loaded using Next.js's optimized Script component
2. Analytics code runs after the page becomes interactive
3. Proper boolean attribute handling for script tags
4. Non-blocking script loading for optimal performance

To add your own analytics or third-party scripts:
1. Add your script configuration to `config/config.ts`
2. Scripts in `head` array load in `<head>`, scripts in `body` array load at end of `<body>`
3. Choose appropriate loading strategy based on script priority
4. Use empty string (`""`) for boolean attributes like `defer` or `async`

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craftled/bordful
cd bordful
npm install
```

2. Set up Airtable:

**Option A** - Quick Setup with Template:

- Visit the demo base template: https://airtable.com/appLx3b8wF3cyfoMd/shrWo1VUVq7mJS6CB
- Click "Use this data" in the top right corner
- Make sure to note the name of your table (default is "Jobs") - you'll need this for the AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME environment variable
- The base includes demo data and all required fields properly configured

**Option B** - Manual Setup:

- Create a new base in Airtable
- Create a table with your desired name (default is "Jobs") with these fields:
  ```
  title: Single line text
  company: Single line text
  type: Single select (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Freelance)
  salary_min: Number
  salary_max: Number
  salary_currency: Single select (USD, EUR, GBP)
  salary_unit: Single select (hour, day, week, month, year, project)
  description: Long text (with rich text enabled)
  apply_url: URL
  posted_date: Date
  status: Single select (active, inactive)
  workplace_type: Single select (On-site, Hybrid, Remote, Not specified)
  remote_region: Single select (Worldwide, Americas Only, Europe Only, Asia-Pacific Only, US Only, EU Only, UK/EU Only, US/Canada Only)
  timezone_requirements: Single line text
  workplace_city: Single line text
  workplace_country: Single select (from ISO 3166 country list)
  career_level: Multiple select (Internship, Entry Level, Associate, Junior, Mid Level, Senior, Staff, Principal, Lead, Manager, Senior Manager, Director, Senior Director, VP, SVP, EVP, C-Level, Founder, Not Specified)
  visa_sponsorship: Single select (Yes, No, Not specified)
  featured: Checkbox
  languages: Multiple select (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian)
  ```

For both options:

- Create a Personal Access Token at https://airtable.com/create/tokens
- Add these scopes to your token:
  - data.records:read
  - schema.bases:read
- Add your base to the token's access list

3. Environment Setup:

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (keep the example file for reference):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # or copy manually if you're on Windows
   ```

   - Fill in your Airtable credentials in the `.env` file:

   ```env
   AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
   AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=your_table_name_here (defaults to "Jobs" if not specified)
   ```

   > Note: Keep the `.env.example` file intact. If you need to start fresh or share the project, you'll have a reference for the required environment variables.

4. Development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your job board.

### Implementation
The sitemap is generated using Next.js's built-in Metadata API in `app/sitemap.ts`:

```typescript
// Example sitemap entry
{
  url: 'https://yourdomain.com/jobs/senior-developer-at-company',
  lastModified: new Date(),
  changeFrequency: 'daily',
  priority: 0.7
}
```

### Configuration
1. Set your production URL in `.env`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

2. The sitemap will be available at:
```
https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

3. Submit your sitemap to search engines:
- Google Search Console
- Bing Webmaster Tools
- Other search engines as needed

### Automatic Updates
- Sitemap updates automatically with new jobs
- Uses Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- No manual rebuilds required
- 5-minute revalidation period

## Customization

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Main configuration files:

- `tailwind.config.ts`: Theme configuration
- `app/globals.css`: Global styles
- `components/*`: Individual component styles

### Script Management

The job board provides a flexible system for adding analytics, tracking, or any third-party scripts using Next.js's built-in Script component. Scripts can be easily configured in `config/config.ts`:

```typescript
scripts: {
  head: [
    // Scripts to be loaded in <head>
    {
      src: "https://analytics.com/script.js",
      strategy: "afterInteractive",
      attributes: {
        "data-website-id": "xxx",
        defer: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      }
    }
  ],
  body: [
    // Scripts to be loaded at end of <body>
    {
      src: "https://widget.com/embed.js",
      strategy: "lazyOnload",
      attributes: {
        async: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Loading Strategies

Next.js provides three loading strategies for scripts:

- `beforeInteractive`: Loads and executes before the page becomes interactive
  - Use for critical scripts that must load first
  - Example: Polyfills, core functionality that's needed immediately
  - Note: This blocks page interactivity, so use sparingly

- `afterInteractive` (recommended for analytics): Loads after the page becomes interactive
  - Best for analytics and tracking scripts
  - Example: Google Analytics, Umami, Plausible
  - Doesn't block page loading but still loads early enough to track user behavior

- `lazyOnload`: Loads during idle time
  - Use for non-critical scripts
  - Example: Chat widgets, social media embeds
  - Loads last to prioritize page performance

#### Example: Adding Analytics

To add Umami Analytics:

```typescript
scripts: {
  head: [
    {
      src: "https://analytics.example.com/script.js",
      strategy: "afterInteractive",  // Best for analytics
      attributes: {
        "data-website-id": "your-website-id",
        defer: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Script Attributes

You can add any HTML script attributes using the `attributes` object:

```typescript
attributes: {
  defer: "",     // Boolean attributes use empty string
  async: "",     // Boolean attributes use empty string
  "data-id": "xxx",  // Regular attributes use values
  id: "my-script",
  crossorigin: "anonymous"
  // ... any valid script attribute
}
```

This implementation:
- Uses Next.js best practices for script loading
- Provides type safety with TypeScript
- Allows easy configuration in one place
- Supports any third-party script
- Optimizes performance with proper loading strategies

### Data Source

Current implementation uses Airtable. To use a different data source:

1. Modify `lib/db/airtable.ts`
2. Implement the same interface for job data

## Deployment

1. Push to GitHub
2. Deploy on Vercel:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy
