## Script Management & Analytics

Bordful uses Next.js's built-in Script component for optimal script loading and performance. Scripts can be configured in `config/config.ts`:

```typescript
scripts: {
  head: [
    // Scripts to load in the <head> section
    {
      src: "your-script-url",
      strategy: "afterInteractive", // or "beforeInteractive", "lazyOnload"
      attributes: {
        // Additional script attributes
        "data-custom": "value",
        defer: "", // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      },
    },
  ],
  body: [
    // Scripts to load at the end of <body>
  ],
}
```

### Script Loading Strategies

- **beforeInteractive**: Use for critical scripts that must load before page becomes interactive
- **afterInteractive**: Best for analytics and non-critical tracking (default)
- **lazyOnload**: For low-priority scripts that can load last

### Analytics Integration

The starter comes pre-configured for Umami Analytics:
1. Scripts are loaded using Next.js's optimized Script component
2. Analytics code runs after the page becomes interactive
3. Proper boolean attribute handling for script tags
4. Non-blocking script loading for optimal performance

To add your own analytics or third-party scripts:
1. Add your script configuration to `config/config.ts`
2. Scripts in `head` array load in `<head>`, scripts in `body` array load at end of `<body>`
3. Choose appropriate loading strategy based on script priority
4. Use empty string (`""`) for boolean attributes like `defer` or `async`

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craftled/bordful
cd bordful
npm install
```

2. Set up Airtable:

**Option A** - Quick Setup with Template:

- Visit the demo base template: https://airtable.com/appLx3b8wF3cyfoMd/shrWo1VUVq7mJS6CB
- Click "Use this data" in the top right corner
- Make sure to note the name of your table (default is "Jobs") - you'll need this for the AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME environment variable
- The base includes demo data and all required fields properly configured

**Option B** - Manual Setup:

- Create a new base in Airtable
- Create a table with your desired name (default is "Jobs") with these fields:
  ```
  title: Single line text
  company: Single line text
  type: Single select (Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Freelance)
  salary_min: Number
  salary_max: Number
  salary_currency: Single select (USD, EUR, GBP)
  salary_unit: Single select (hour, day, week, month, year, project)
  description: Long text (with rich text enabled)
  apply_url: URL
  posted_date: Date
  status: Single select (active, inactive)
  workplace_type: Single select (On-site, Hybrid, Remote, Not specified)
  remote_region: Single select (Worldwide, Americas Only, Europe Only, Asia-Pacific Only, US Only, EU Only, UK/EU Only, US/Canada Only)
  timezone_requirements: Single line text
  workplace_city: Single line text
  workplace_country: Single select (from ISO 3166 country list)
  career_level: Multiple select (Internship, Entry Level, Associate, Junior, Mid Level, Senior, Staff, Principal, Lead, Manager, Senior Manager, Director, Senior Director, VP, SVP, EVP, C-Level, Founder, Not Specified)
  visa_sponsorship: Single select (Yes, No, Not specified)
  featured: Checkbox
  languages: Multiple select (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian)
  ```

For both options:

- Create a Personal Access Token at https://airtable.com/create/tokens
- Add these scopes to your token:
  - data.records:read
  - schema.bases:read
- Add your base to the token's access list

3. Environment Setup:

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (keep the example file for reference):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # or copy manually if you're on Windows
   ```

   - Fill in your Airtable credentials in the `.env` file:

   ```env
   AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
   AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=your_table_name_here (defaults to "Jobs" if not specified)
   ```

   > Note: Keep the `.env.example` file intact. If you need to start fresh or share the project, you'll have a reference for the required environment variables.

4. Development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your job board.

## Configuration

### Quick Start

1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.ts config/config.ts
   ```
2. Customize `config.ts` with your settings
3. The app will now use your custom configuration

### How It Works

The configuration system is designed to be:
- Easy to set up (just copy and customize)
- Flexible (customize any aspect of your job board)
- Maintainable (pull updates without losing your customizations)

When the app starts:
1. It first tries to load your custom `config.ts`
2. If not found, falls back to `config.example.ts`
3. TypeScript ensures type safety in both cases

### Updating

When pulling updates from upstream:
1. Your `config.ts` stays as is with your customizations
2. You might get updates to `config.example.ts`
3. Check `config.example.ts` for new options
4. Add desired new options to your `config.ts`

### Configuration Options

The job board can be customized through the configuration file:

```typescript
export const config = {
  // Marketing & SEO
  badge: "The #1 Open Source Tech Job Board",
  title: "Find Your Next Tech Role",
  description: "Browse curated tech opportunities...",
  url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || "http://localhost:3000",

  // Scripts Configuration (analytics, tracking, etc.)
  scripts: {
    head: [
      // Scripts to be loaded in <head>
      {
        src: "https://analytics.com/script.js",
        strategy: "afterInteractive",
        attributes: {
          "data-website-id": "xxx",
          defer: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
        }
      }
    ],
    body: [
      // Scripts to be loaded at end of <body>
      {
        src: "https://widget.com/embed.js",
        strategy: "lazyOnload",
        attributes: {
          async: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
        }
      }
    ]
  },

  // Navigation
  nav: {
    title: "JobBoard", // Navigation bar text
    icon: "Briefcase", // Lucide icon name
    logo: {
      enabled: false, // Set to true to use a custom logo instead of icon + text
      src: "/your-logo.svg", // Path to your logo image (place it in the public directory)
      width: 120, // Width of the logo in pixels
      height: 32, // Height of the logo in pixels
      alt: "Your Company Logo", // Alt text for the logo
    },
    github: {
      show: true, // Show/hide GitHub button
      url: "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo",
    },
    linkedin: {
      show: true, // Show/hide LinkedIn button
      url: "https://linkedin.com/company/yourcompany",
    },
    twitter: {
      show: true, // Show/hide Twitter/X button
      url: "https://x.com/yourhandle",
    },
    bluesky: {
      show: true, // Show/hide Bluesky button
      url: "https://bsky.app/profile/yourdomain.com",
    },
    postJob: {
      show: true, // Show/hide Post Job button
      label: "Post a Job", // Button text
      link: "/post", // Button URL
    },
    topMenu: [
      // Navigation menu items
      { label: "Home", link: "/" },
      { label: "Jobs", link: "/jobs" },
      { label: "About", link: "/about" },
      { label: "Changelog", link: "/changelog" },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Environment-Aware URLs

The site URL automatically adjusts based on the environment:

1. Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` if provided
2. Falls back to `localhost:3000` in development
3. Uses production URL in production

### Navigation Customization

- **Icon & Logo**: Choose between:
  - Default mode: Uses [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons) with text
  - Custom logo: Enable custom logo mode and specify your logo image
- **Title**: Customize the text shown in the navigation bar (when not using custom logo)
- **Social Media**: Toggle visibility and set URLs for:
  - GitHub repository
  - LinkedIn company page
  - Twitter/X profile
  - Bluesky profile
- **Post Job Button**: Customize the job posting button:
  - Toggle visibility
  - Change button text
  - Set custom URL
- **Top Menu**: Define navigation menu items with labels and links
  - Each item has a label and link
  - Order items as needed
  - Add or remove menu items easily

## Environment Variables

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never commit your API keys or sensitive credentials to the repository!

Required environment variables:

- AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
- AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
- AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=your_table_name_here (defaults to "Jobs" if not specified)

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add these variables there.

## Data Revalidation

The job board uses Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) and server-side caching to keep data fresh:

- Pages automatically revalidate every 5 minutes
- Server-side caching with unstable_cache
- Content-specific loading states
- New jobs appear without manual rebuilds
- Maintains fast static page delivery
- Zero downtime updates

You can adjust the revalidation interval in:
- `app/page.tsx` (job listing page)
- `app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` (individual job pages)
- `app/jobs/language/[language]/page.tsx` (language-specific job pages)

### Implementation
The sitemap is generated using Next.js's built-in Metadata API in `app/sitemap.ts`:

```typescript
// Example sitemap entry
{
  url: 'https://yourdomain.com/jobs/senior-developer-at-company',
  lastModified: new Date(),
  changeFrequency: 'daily',
  priority: 0.7
}
```

### Configuration
1. Set your production URL in `.env`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

2. The sitemap will be available at:
```
https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

3. Submit your sitemap to search engines:
- Google Search Console
- Bing Webmaster Tools
- Other search engines as needed

### Automatic Updates
- Sitemap updates automatically with new jobs
- Uses Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- No manual rebuilds required
- 5-minute revalidation period

## Customization

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Main configuration files:

- `tailwind.config.ts`: Theme configuration
- `app/globals.css`: Global styles
- `components/*`: Individual component styles

### Script Management

The job board provides a flexible system for adding analytics, tracking, or any third-party scripts using Next.js's built-in Script component. Scripts can be easily configured in `config/config.ts`:

```typescript
scripts: {
  head: [
    // Scripts to be loaded in <head>
    {
      src: "https://analytics.com/script.js",
      strategy: "afterInteractive",
      attributes: {
        "data-website-id": "xxx",
        defer: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      }
    }
  ],
  body: [
    // Scripts to be loaded at end of <body>
    {
      src: "https://widget.com/embed.js",
      strategy: "lazyOnload",
      attributes: {
        async: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Loading Strategies

Next.js provides three loading strategies for scripts:

- `beforeInteractive`: Loads and executes before the page becomes interactive
  - Use for critical scripts that must load first
  - Example: Polyfills, core functionality that's needed immediately
  - Note: This blocks page interactivity, so use sparingly

- `afterInteractive` (recommended for analytics): Loads after the page becomes interactive
  - Best for analytics and tracking scripts
  - Example: Google Analytics, Umami, Plausible
  - Doesn't block page loading but still loads early enough to track user behavior

- `lazyOnload`: Loads during idle time
  - Use for non-critical scripts
  - Example: Chat widgets, social media embeds
  - Loads last to prioritize page performance

#### Example: Adding Analytics

To add Umami Analytics:

```typescript
scripts: {
  head: [
    {
      src: "https://analytics.example.com/script.js",
      strategy: "afterInteractive",  // Best for analytics
      attributes: {
        "data-website-id": "your-website-id",
        defer: ""  // Boolean attributes should use empty string
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Script Attributes

You can add any HTML script attributes using the `attributes` object:

```typescript
attributes: {
  defer: "",     // Boolean attributes use empty string
  async: "",     // Boolean attributes use empty string
  "data-id": "xxx",  // Regular attributes use values
  id: "my-script",
  crossorigin: "anonymous"
  // ... any valid script attribute
}
```

This implementation:
- Uses Next.js best practices for script loading
- Provides type safety with TypeScript
- Allows easy configuration in one place
- Supports any third-party script
- Optimizes performance with proper loading strategies

### Data Source

Current implementation uses Airtable. To use a different data source:

1. Modify `lib/db/airtable.ts`
2. Implement the same interface for job data

## Deployment

### Local Build Verification

Before deploying to production, it's recommended to verify your build locally:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test the production build
npm start
```

This ensures that your changes work correctly in a production environment before deploying to Vercel.

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Push to GitHub
2. Deploy on Vercel:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy
